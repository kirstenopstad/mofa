Name of Project: MOFA - The Museum of Fake Art

Project's Purpose or Goal: Recreate the user experience of visiting a art musuem website. By presenting AI-generated artwork in a format typically reserved for fine art, the application intends to provoke conversation around the following questions: 
* what makes art "real" or "fake"?
* is it possible to have a "real" human experiences with "fake" art?
* what are the social / cultural / human implications of the development of generative AI?

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
1. MOFA displays works of AI-generated artwork (hereby known as fake art)
2. MOFA allows users to add title/comment to fake art
3. MOFA allows users to upvote/downvote titles/comments of fake art

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
  * React
  * Redux
  * Firebase
  * DALLâ€¢E 2 API

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
1. Style front end to match design norms for reference museums 
2. Handle user login & registration
  * Add functionality so users may only vote once per work
3. Ensure responsive design functionality across devices
4. Gather user feedback
5. Incorporate user feedback
6. Publish hosted site
7. Implement CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery) with github Actions

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
  * 
  * [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/)
  * [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart)

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?

I'd like this project to demonstrate front end and back end skills, incorporate my background in art & design, and at the very least, be a conversation portfolio piece.
