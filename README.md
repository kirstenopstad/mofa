#### By Kirsten Opstad

#### A web app that exhibits AI-generated artwork
***
![Wireframe Mockup](./src/img/gen_images/img-vujGHIheyP5efqoS37Urs2w3.png)
<i>Fake art, generated from the prompt: "a poker game of fish, Lyonel Feininger eqsue"</i>
*** 
## Description

Recreate the user experience of visiting an art musuem website with completely AI-generated artwork. By presenting AI-generated artwork in a format typically reserved for fine (real) art, the application intends to provoke conversation around the following questions: 
* what makes art "real" or "fake"?
* is it possible to have a "real" human experiences with "fake" art?
* what are the social / cultural / human implications of the development of generative AI?
*** 
## Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* React
* Firebase
* webpack
* Node.js
* Axios
* Bootstrap
* HTML
* CSS

***
### __Objectives__ (MVP)

The application should have the following functionality:

__User stories:__
* âœ… Users can view exhibition of AI-generated artwork as a gallery or individually
* âœ… Users can add title/comment to AI-generated artwork
* âœ… Users can  upvote/downvote titles/comments of AI-generated artwork

### __Further Exploration__ (Stretch Goals)

__User stories:__
* âœ… Users can register and login
* âœ… Users may only vote once per AI-generated artwork

<!-- ### __Big Picture__
![Big Picture](./src/img/big_picture.png) -->

### __Implementation__
1. âœ… Create component drawing
2. âœ… Establish Component Hierarchy
    <!-- * App.js
      * Header.js
      * PlanVisit.js
      * ExhControl.js 
        * ExhList.js - displays all art in all exhibitions
          * Exhibit.js
        * ExhDetail.js - displays all art in one exhibition
          * Artwork.js
        * ArtworkDetail.js 
      * Footer.js -->
3. âœ… Build Static Components
4. âœ… Add State
5. âœ… Add Firebase to store data
6. âœ… Add Authentication
7. âœ… Add Authorization (title / vote)
8. âœ… Style to match mockup

***
### __Goals__
1. âœ… Meet MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
2. âœ… Implement at least one stretch goal
3. âœ… Create thorough documentation of process

### __Stretch Goals__
1. Style front end to match design norms for reference museums 
2. âœ… Handle user login & registration
    * âœ… Add functionality so users may only vote once per work
3.  âœ… Ensure responsive design functionality across devices
4. ðŸ“Œ Gather user feedback
5. Incorporate user feedback
6. âœ… Publish hosted site
7. Implement CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery) with github Actions
8. Create functionality automatically generate new prompts for DALLEâ€¢2
9. âœ… Use app to call DALLâ€¢E API
10. ðŸ“Œ Use Firebase to save .png from URL and store in Google cloud
